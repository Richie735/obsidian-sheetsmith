# UI conventions

How a Sheetsmith sheet looks and behaves. Read this when designing a component
and when reviewing one; `docs/PATTERNS.md` covers the code side, `SPEC.md`
covers what the plugin does.

Markers match `PATTERNS.md`: **[checked]** fails the build, **[warned]** is a
lint warning that does not, **[judgement]** is a default with a reason.

The design reviewer should look at the **harness** (`npm run harness`) rather
than at CSS. Reviewing appearance by reading a stylesheet describes what the
code should look like, not what it does.

The harness renders **both** screens: the sheet, and the settings tab holding
the layout editor. The editor is where most of a sheet is actually configured,
so it gets the same scrutiny as the cards. The two are joined, so saving in the
editor re-renders the sheet and a config field can be judged by what it does to
the card rather than by its label alone.

---

## 1. The plugin has no colours of its own

**Never write a literal colour** [judgement, should be checked]. Not a hex, not
an `rgb()`, not a named colour. There are zero in 322 selectors today and that
number should stay zero.

Every colour comes from an Obsidian theme variable, so a sheet inherits whatever
theme the user runs:

- text: `--text-normal`, `--text-muted`, `--text-faint`, `--text-accent`,
  `--text-error`, `--text-on-accent`
- background: `--background-primary`, `--background-primary-alt`,
  `--background-secondary`
- state: `--background-modifier-hover`, `--background-modifier-active-hover`,
  `--background-modifier-border`, `--background-modifier-error`
- accent: `--interactive-accent`, `--interactive-accent-hover`

Sizing, spacing, radii and fonts come from the same place: `--size-4-*`,
`--size-2-*`, `--radius-s|m|l`, `--font-ui-*`, `--font-smallest`,
`--font-monospace`, `--icon-s`, `--layer-popover`.

### Deriving a colour safely

Blend with `color-mix(in srgb, ...)` against `--background-primary`, never with
opacity on the element. The graded level fill is the model:

```css
background-color: color-mix(
	in srgb,
	var(--interactive-accent) calc(var(--sheetsmith-level, 1) * 100%),
	var(--background-primary)
);
```

Text placed on such a blend uses `--text-normal`, which is defined against
`--background-primary`, the same colour the blend is mixed with, so it holds in
a light theme and a dark one alike. That reasoning is the rule: **pick the text
variable defined against whatever you mixed into**.

---

## 2. The `.sheetsmith-view` scope rule

Every rule styling a form control on a sheet must be scoped under
`.sheetsmith-view` [checked: `styles.test.ts`].

Obsidian styles `input[type='text']` at specificity (0,1,1). A bare class is
(0,1,0) and loses, so every declaration taking chrome off an input is dropped
with no warning and the field keeps its form-control look and its small font.
This is invisible in review precisely when it matters most: a component that paints its
own border never reveals the loss. Pool shipped that way once.

`styles.test.ts` is the guard. If you add a field class, it is covered
automatically by the `-input` / `-current` naming; a control named outside that
pattern needs the test widened.

---

## 3. Sheetsmith's own knobs

The plugin's tunables are custom properties declared on `body`, prefixed
`--sheetsmith-`, each carrying the reason it holds that value. They exist to be
overridden from a user CSS snippet.

Publish one **when a second component has to line up with the first**. The
comment on `--sheetsmith-card-abbr-space` states the test: re-deriving
`1.2 × 0.85 × --font-ui-smaller` somewhere else would drift the moment either
constant moved.

A knob is public API once shipped. Renaming it breaks someone's snippet.

---

## 4. Space, and how the sheet reflows

- **A component fills its grid placement** (`SPEC` §8). A card placed two
  columns wide occupies two columns. Stat group's opt-in `fixed` sizing is the
  single exception.
- **The sheet fills the pane.** A sheet is a dashboard, not prose, so nothing
  holds it at reading width. `--sheetsmith-sheet-max-width` gives reading width back
  to anyone who wants it.
- **Reflow uses a container query, never a media query** [judgement]. A narrow
  split in a wide window must reflow too, and a media query cannot see that.
  `.sheetsmith-view` sets `container-type: inline-size`; the grid collapses to a
  column under 480px of *container* width.
- **Media queries are for user preference and device capability only**:
  `prefers-reduced-motion`, `forced-colors`, pointer coarseness. Never for space.
- **Cascade order is load-bearing.** `@container` adds no specificity, so an
  override must sit *below* the rule it overrides. An equal selector placed
  above it simply loses.

---

## 5. Type

- **Relative units for anything that should follow the vault's text-size
  setting** [judgement]. The card's headline number is `1.75em`, not a pixel
  size, so the card scales with the user's setting.
- `--font-ui-small` / `--font-ui-smaller` for secondary and tertiary text;
  `--font-smallest` below that.
- **`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on every number that changes.** A value
  that reflows while stepping reads as movement the user did not ask for.
- Secondary text, an abbreviation under a stat name or a gloss beside a row, is
  one style: sized down, tracked, faint. Reuse it rather than inventing a
  second quiet style.

---

## 6. Accessibility is part of the control

Not a pass afterwards. Each of these is already load-bearing somewhere in the
sheet.

- **Forced-colors mode discards `box-shadow`.** A focus ring drawn as a
  box-shadow carries a transparent `outline` companion, invisible in an ordinary
  theme and repainted as a real ring wherever the browser drops shadows:
  ```css
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--interactive-accent);
  outline: 2px solid transparent;
  ```
  Prefer an outline outright where the offset allows it.
- **One focus treatment per component.** The same gesture in the same component
  must not produce two different rings.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` removes transitions**, and every animated
  rule needs the companion block.
- **`.sheetsmith-sr-only`** carries text for assistive tech only.
- **`aria-label` replaces a name; `title` adds to one.** A control whose text is
  on screen keeps that text as its accessible name, and anything supplementary —
  where a link goes, what a glyph is called — rides in `title`. An `aria-label`
  there announces a word that appears nowhere in the control, which fails WCAG
  2.5.3 and leaves voice control nothing to match. An aliased wikilink in a cell
  was the case that taught this: it copied Obsidian's own markup, which puts the
  link target in `aria-label`. `aria-label` is for a control whose visible mark is
  *not* words — a ring, a glyph button — which is the next rule.
- **State goes in ARIA, not only in paint.** `aria-pressed` on a two-state mark;
  `aria-label` composed from the label and the state name the layout author
  chose, since "Stowed" says more than "not pressed".
- **Announce what is not visible.** A commit or an Escape-restore that changes
  nothing on screen is announced.

---

## 7. Touch

- **A finger has no hover and no pixel to aim at.** Hit targets are the card,
  not the mark: a ring is 1.6em, and a card answering only on the ring reads as
  dead everywhere else.
- **Focus on `pointerdown`, commit on `click`.** A tap cannot preview what it is
  about to hit, so focus moves while the finger is down; committing on release
  is what lets a mis-aimed press slide off and be taken back.
- Never a hover-only affordance. Anything reachable by hover is reachable
  another way.

---

## 8. Motion

Movement is judged by frequency first. A character sheet is a control panel: the
same rings, pools and tracks are pressed dozens of times in a session, so
anything that animates on every press puts a wait in front of every press, and
the sheet gets slower to use the longer the session runs. **Restraint here is the correct answer, not a lack of ambition.**

The sheet also lives inside someone's notes and should not behave more
energetically than the app around it.

- **Motion earns its place by doing a job** [judgement]: showing state changed,
  keeping the reader oriented, softening a jump, confirming a press landed.
  Anything touched every few seconds gets feedback, not animation.
- **Transitions, never `@keyframes`** [judgement]. A transition can be
  interrupted and retargeted mid-flight; a keyframe animation restarts from
  zero. Everything here is repeatable and reversible, so everything is a
  transition. The plugin currently has zero `@keyframes` and that is worth
  keeping.
- **Never `ease-in`.** It delays the instant the user is watching.
- **Motion stays under 300ms.** A colour or opacity fade is not motion and may
  run longer when it is deliberately slow.
- **Prefer `transform` and `opacity`.** Animating `width` or `height` costs
  layout and paint, so it needs a reason stated in a comment. The pool fill and
  the track response both animate `width` and both carry that reason.
- **Gesture values are grabbable at any instant** and continue from where they
  are, rather than snapping to a start.

The tuned constants in `src/interaction/`, covering projection deceleration,
throw decay, scrub resistance, the hold ramp and the velocity window, are
decisions taken against the real control, with the argument in the code beside
them. Treat them
as settled unless a specific failure is observed.

The full standards, and the vocabulary for describing motion precisely, are in
`.claude/skills/design-review/reference/motion.md`.

---

## 9. The shared vocabulary

New components reuse these rather than inventing a lookalike. A fourth kind of
panel beside a row of cards reads as loose chrome floating on the page.

| Thing | Where | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The card | `.sheetsmith-stat`, `.sheetsmith-stat-single` | Stat, Stat group, Pool |
| The level ring | `paintLevelRing`, `.sheetsmith-table-cycle` | Table columns, Track marks |
| The editing gesture | `editable.ts` | every stored value on a sheet |
| Secondary text | `.sheetsmith-stat-abbreviation` | Stat group |
| Inline error | `.sheetsmith-error` | every component's own failure |
| Arm, then commit | `.sheetsmith-table-remove-button` | Table's row delete |
| A total under a table | `tfoot` + `.sheetsmith-table-value` | Table's column totals |
| A control in the row position | `.sheetsmith-table-add` | Table's add row |
| Rendered text over its own field | `.sheetsmith-table-linked` | Table's wikilinks |
| Reveal on hover, only when clipped | `ui/truncation.ts` | Stat card's label, Table's links |

**An irreversible control arms before it fires** [judgement]. The first press
takes a warning tint, marks what it would take, and names it; the second
applies it. §12's rule from the pool's typed amount is the reason: where a
control's input is not its outcome, the outcome has to be on screen before it is
applied, and an irreversible outcome is the strongest case of it. The shared
confirmation is also not available to reach for — `ConfirmModal` takes an `App`
and `RenderContext` carries no route to one, so a component's only confirmation
surface is the card itself. **The
next press anywhere else stands it down**, along with Escape, focus leaving the
control, and arming another one; all of them leave the file exactly as it was.
The outside press is the load-bearing one, and it is §7 again: a finger has no
gesture for moving focus away, and a tap does not focus a button, so a control
disarmed only by `blur` is a two-step gesture that becomes one step on touch.
`popover.ts` makes the same dismissal for the same reason.

**Rendered text and the field that edits it are stacked, never swapped**
[judgement]. Both sit in one grid cell: the field stays in the DOM and in the tab
order in both states, which is what keeps the view's focus restoration counting
the same controls across a rebuild, and neither child changes size on focus, so
nothing reflows under a pointer already resting on the cell. Unfocused, the
display layer is opaque over a field whose own text is transparent, and only the
links inside it take a press — everything else falls through to the field, so a
click still puts the caret where it landed. A cell with nothing to render gets
none of it, which is what keeps an eighteen-row card the DOM it always had.

**Borrowing one of Obsidian's class names buys the name, not the styling**
[checked: `styles.test.ts`]. Every `.internal-link` rule in `app.css` is scoped to
`.markdown-rendered` or `.metadata-property-value`, and the editor's unresolved
marker to `.markdown-source-view.mod-cm6`. A sheet is none of those, so an anchor
in a cell gets the bare `a` rule — colour, underline, pointer — and no state
styling at all: a link to a note that does not exist looked exactly like one to a
note that does. So a state class on a borrowed element is styled here, under the
view scope, from the app's own documented variables. And give the ones that carry
the meaning a fallback: an undefined custom property makes `color` invalid at
computed-value time, which computes to `inherit`, so a missing variable paints a
link in the cell's own text colour and it stops reading as a link at all.

The delete glyph is deliberately **not** a shared class. It borrows the level
ring's measurements through `--sheetsmith-table-control`, because two glyph
buttons in one table row must not measure differently under the same finger, and
that number is the whole of the agreement: two consumers earn duplication, not a
module (`PATTERNS.md` §1). This table gains a class when a third appears.

**When a card and a cell do the same job, they share the painter** [judgement].
A single-level mark on a card and the same mark in a table cell must go through
`paintLevelRing` rather than a lookalike, precisely so one flag cannot measure
differently from the other under the same finger.

---

## 10. Failure appears in place

A misconfigured component renders `.sheetsmith-error` into its own container and
nothing else. The rest of the sheet stays live and editable (`SPEC` §10). There
is no global error state, and a broken component never blanks the page.

Error text names the fix: `"max: 'con' is not defined on this sheet"`, not
`"could not resolve"`.

---

## 11. Reviewing appearance

Run `npm run harness`. Check each of these, because none is visible in code.

**The sheet:**

- both themes, light and dark
- narrow container: does the grid actually collapse, and does anything overflow
- a component at 1, 2 and 3 grid columns wide: does it fill its placement
- numbers mid-step: do they jitter, or hold on tabular figures
- focus: visible on every interactive element, one treatment per component
- an error state and an empty state, not only the populated one

**A harness that rebuilds on hover cannot review anything a pointer does.** The
fake link context redrew the sheet on a preview, so the element under the pointer
was replaced mid-gesture: a press landed on one anchor and released on its
replacement, the click never dispatched, and a tooltip revealed on hover vanished
with the element that had it. The app rebuilds on an edit and never on a preview,
so every one of those failures was the instrument's. Anything the harness does in
response to a gesture updates in place.

**An approximation in the harness for something the plugin should own is worse
than no approximation.** The unresolved-link colour was written into
`harness/theme.css` first, so the harness showed the two link states as different
shades while the app showed them identical — the instrument was kinder than the
thing, and the review passed. When a stand-in makes a shot look right, check
which stylesheet is doing the work.

Run `npm run harness:calibrate` first. It reads the installed Obsidian's own
`app.css` out of its asar and generates the real theme palette and settings
chrome, so the harness borrows Obsidian's frame instead of approximating it.
Re-run it after an Obsidian update. Without it the harness falls back to the
hand-written approximation in `harness/theme.css` and is close but not exact.

`npm run harness:shot` renders every view to `harness/shots/`, covering both
themes, both screens, the narrow reflow, and the empty and error states, so a
review can look at PNGs rather than clicking through.

**The settings tab** (`Surface → Settings`, or `Both` for the two side by side):

- does a new config field read as a setting, or as a form field dumped in a list
- is its description a consequence, or a restatement of its label (§8 of
  `PATTERNS.md`)
- do the list-shaped fields for rows, columns, attributes and triggers stay
  legible once they hold ten entries rather than two
- does the grid preview agree with what the sheet actually renders
- what happens to the sheet when the field changes: `Both` shows it live

---

## 12. Backlog

Where the code does not yet match this file. These are findings, not licences:
new work follows the sections above. A row leaves when it is fixed. A backlog
that keeps solved rows stops being read.

| Gap | Where | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An unlabelled example reads as the field's value | `editor/trigger-list-field.ts`, `editor/function-library-field.ts`, `editor/layout-editor.ts` | Each renders a bare `<code>` under its description with no framing word, while the textarea's own `setPlaceholder` already carries a *different* example in the idiomatic place. In the harness sample the function library's visible example is byte-identical to the saved value, so the field reads as though the value were printed twice, and the triggers field shows "Short rest" both as the example and as a real entry. Frame it with "For example: …", or drop it and let the placeholder do the work. |
| The stat note clips mid-word | `.sheetsmith-stat-note-input` | No `text-overflow`, so at a 620px container "chain mail, shield" renders as "chain mail, sl": a hard cut with room to spare inside the pill, which reads as damaged data rather than as truncation. Five other rules in `sheet.css` already set `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and the card label directly above it correctly shows "ARMOUR C…". Set it here too, since it applies to an unfocused input, and carry the full value in `title`. |
| §9 names Track as a user of the level ring | §9 above, `components/track.ts` | `paintLevelRing`'s only callers are `table.ts` and `editor/list-fields.ts`. Track imports `levelGlyph`, `levelName` and `parseLevel` and paints its own segments, which render as rounded squares against the ring's circles. The two shapes probably *should* differ, since a track counts marks across segments while a ring cycles one value, so the fix is the table rather than the code. As written, §9 promises a shared painter that does not exist, which is the drift it exists to warn about. |

Add a row when a review finds a gap it is not fixing in the same pass.
