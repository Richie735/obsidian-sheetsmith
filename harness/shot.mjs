 * Screenshot the harness, so a review can look at the UI instead of reading CSS.

 * Uses whatever Chrome is installed, headless. No browser dependency is added
 * to the project for this: the harness is a static page, and a screenshot of it
 * is not worth a hundred megabytes of node_modules.
 *
 *   node harness/shot.mjs                          # every default view
 *   node harness/shot.mjs surface=settings theme=dark width=620
 *
 * Views are addressed by the harness's own query parameters, so anything
 * reachable by clicking is reachable by a shot. Output lands in harness/shots/,
 * which is gitignored.
